# Description

I moved in Berlin in July 2022. And I realised that there no any specialty coffe map here(in Russia we have it).\
Well, this is it.\
Used Mapbox as map provider and [react-map-gl](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/) as library, I create this little MVP.\
Here you can bookmark places as Favorites, create a Route to place and see is open status

In plans transfer all data to Firebase, and more fansy UI.
